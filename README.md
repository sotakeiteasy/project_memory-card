# Neon genesis memory

Live version available [here](https://neon-genesis-memory.netlify.app/).

Another small project to practice with React basics (mostly effects) and CSS. When figuring out how to make it more fancy found a cool [website](https://freefrontend.com/css-border-examples/) with lots of frames templates, used [one of them](https://codepen.io/piccalilli/pen/MPLzay).
